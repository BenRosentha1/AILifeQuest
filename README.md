# AILifeQuest
This is a text based adventure game that uses ChatGPT as a backend storyteller.  You step through the life of your character, set in the time period of your choosing, and make decisions based on prompting events.  Have Fun!

This is my first personal project I am proud of.  I know it's nothing crazy but it taught me a lot about programming and the project actually has a use.
By building this project I learned a lot and gained a lot of skills.  Before this project I had never worked with JSON objects before but now I am familiar with them.
I have also not worked out how to use any library outside of the standard ones before so getting that experience with ChatGPT was enlightening.
I have never had a reason to make a .gitignore file but as my API key is sensitive I was influenced to learn about this.
My functions are all very modular and with little changes the LLM model can be changed.
